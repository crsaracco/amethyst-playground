# Cones

A 201x201 grid of cones, where the shapes are generated in code instead of using asset/prefab files. The lights and camera also oscillate based on game time.

This project started as a clone of Amethyst's [material](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/tree/master/examples/material) example, then I morphed it into what it is now.

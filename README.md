# amethyst-playground

A bunch of random little experiments using the Amethyst game engine, while I learn the concepts. Maybe someone else will find these useful for their own learning?

This repo is a collection of different Rust projects, which I'll list below:

 - [Cones](projects/cones/) - A 201x201 grid of cones, where the shapes are generated in code instead of using asset/prefab files. The lights and camera also oscillate based on game time.

For all of these, you'll probably want to run the project with `cargo run --release`.
